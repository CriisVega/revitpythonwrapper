Forms:
☐ Add Form Wrapper for exit_on_close FlexForm + Console
☐ Forms  - List Form
☐ Merge Ehsan's Forms

Others Merge:
☐ Transaction (Status)
☐ Logger
☐ AutoCollector

Core:
☐ CRITICAL: Write down Rules for how element vs wrapped elements are returned
> Sometimes are wrapped, sometimes are unwrapped. That's bad!
> Collector uses .wrapped_elements
> Ideally, it would all be wrapped, but since not all elements have working wrappers, that would creat an inconsistency

☐ Add @ensure to all internal methods that require Transaction
  Need to merge transaction first to ensure transaction is only started if not already dunning
☐ Investigate if possible to fake type so Elements can be passed back.
